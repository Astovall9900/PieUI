## Documentation

Other react component libraries are cumbersome, difficult for beginners to use or understand and can have complicated codebases. 
Not here.

These components are simple to implement and just make sense

Add your own styling and css **fully customizable**

## Why use PieUI

Material UI and other component libraries are too complicated for beginners to understand or use. 

The aim of these UI components is to be as user friendly as possible

The components themselves are fully customizable and easy to read for React beginners

Documentation is included for every component to understand the design.

## Development Setup

This is going to require a lot of work, and if you want to contribute or add a component or explanation to make this better it is easy to set up

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]

### Setting Up a Project

Install React globally:

```
npm install -g @react
```

Install NPM packages / dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run the development server

```
cd Hubbot
npm run start
```

### MACOS Users

You might have to either enable permissions for your project directory for vscode (or your editor)

Otherwise you will get access error. Also if NPM is giving you issues in the terminal make sure you run the command as 

``sudo npm [blah blah]``

so you run as administrator.

## Firebase

Planning on using firebase for this, but also might opt for a custom server
